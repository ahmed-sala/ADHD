  '''Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of
the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of
childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and
often lasts into adulthood. ADHD patient may have
trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors
(may act without thinking about what the result will be),
or be overly active.
Signs and Symptoms
The way symptoms affect adults can be very different from the
way they affect children. For example, hyperactivity tends to
decrease in adults, while inattentiveness tends to remain as the
pressures of adult life increase.
As we mentioned before it is normal for children to have trouble
focusing and behaving at one time or another, but children with
ADHD do not just grow out of these behaviors.''',
  '''Although not always the case, some children may also have signs
of other problems or conditions alongside ADHD, such as anxiety
disorder, conduct disorder, learning difficulties, depression
and/or other
In adults, the symptoms of ADHD are more difficult to define, it’s
believed it cannot develop in adults without it first appearing
during childhood. ''',
  '''There are three different ways ADHD presents itself, depending
on which types of symptoms in the individual:
• Predominantly Inattentive Presentation: It is hard for the
individual to organize or finish a task, to pay attention to
details, or to follow instructions or conversations. The
person is easily distracted or forgets details of daily
routines.
• Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation: The
person fidgets and talks a lot. It is hard to sit still for long.
Smaller children may run, jump or climb constantly. The
individual feels restless and has trouble with impulsivity.
Someone who is impulsive may
interrupt others a lot, grab things
from people, or speak at
inappropriate times. It is hard for
the person to wait their turn or
listen to directions. A person with
impulsiveness may have more
accidents and injuries than
others.
• Combined Presentation:
Symptoms of the above two types are equally present in
the person.
Because symptoms can change over time, the presentation may
change over time as well. ''',
  '''Current research shows that genetics plays an important role in
this disease, recent studies link genetic factors with ADHD.
In addition to genetics, scientists are studying other possible
causes and risk factors including:
Brain injury.
Exposure to environmental risks
during pregnancy or at a young
age.
Alcohol and tobacco use during
pregnancy.
Premature delivery.
Low birth weight.
Research does not support the popularly held views that ADHD
is caused by eating too much sugar, or social and environmental
factors such as poverty or family chaos. Of course, many things,
including these, might make symptoms worse. But the evidence
is not strong enough to conclude that they are the main causes
of ADHD. ''',
  '''ADHD can be treated using medicine or therapy, but a
combination of both is often best. Treatment is usually arranged
by a specialist, such as a pediatrician or psychiatrist.
Types of treatment for ADHD include:
1. Behaviour Therapy (including training for parents)
The goals of behavior therapy are to learn or strengthen
positive behaviors and eliminate unwanted or problem
behaviors. Behavior therapy for ADHD can include:
Parent training in behavior management; Behavior therapy
with children; and Behavioral interventions in the
classroom.
2. Medications
Medication can help children manage their ADHD
symptoms in their everyday life and can help them control
the behaviors that cause difficulties with family, friends,
and at school.
Several different types of medications:
Stimulants are the best-known and most widely used
ADHD medications. Between 70-80% of children with ADHD
have fewer ADHD symptoms when taking these fast-acting
medications.
Nonstimulants were approved for the treatment of ADHD
in 2003. They do not work as quickly as stimulants, but
their effect can last up to 24 hours
AND Here are some of the medicines used to correct the
patient's behavior (Warning: Do not take any of these medicines
unless under the supervision of a specialist doctor): 1)Dextroamphetamine   2)Clonidine  
3)STRATTERA   4) RITALIN   5) Metadate   6) Imipramine ''',
  '''You Can you deal with ADHD by:
Encourage him
Emphasize strengths
Be patient
Address specific
problems
Listen to them
Here are some tips that you follow when dealing with
the patient:
1. Make sure to do activities that help him focus and be creative
in a fun and entertaining way.
2. You must participate during playtime and fun to strengthen
the emotional distance with him and contribute to the
development of his abilities.
3. Avoid pressuring your child and yelling at him because he is
suffering from a real problem, not an artificial one.
4. Reducing distractions, removing dangerous materials and
tools, and making games available at the time and place
designated for them only.
5. Use the Color Code system to classify books and notebooks
and their locations. An orange sticker can be placed on Arabic
language books and notebooks, and a blue sticker on English
books and books.
6. Establishing a system for sleeping times, eating habits, playing
and other activities such as drawing and exercising helps people
with hyperactivity and attention deficiency know the behavioral
expectations that need to be achieved.''',
  '''The treatment program(which is determined by a
specialist according to the
patient's condition) must be
maintained to avoid any of the
following complications:
Poor self-esteem
Accidents and injuries
Substance abuse
Delinquent or risky behavior
Trouble interacting with peers; relationship difficulties
Excess weight and eating disorders
Sleep problems ''',
  '''To avoid ADHD in your Child you should:
1) Start your child’s day with a protein-rich breakfast (protein-rich foods
include peanut butter, yogurt, milk, cheese, and eggs).
2) Have your child walk to school if possible.
3) Give your child a quiet place to do his homework.
4) Give your child a 30-minute break after
school to unwind and play before starting
homework.
5) Take walks, hikes, or bike rides with your
child.
6) Listen to your child with mindfulness. Turn
off your cell phone, television, and other
electronic distractions and be present to your child. Give her a safe place to
say anything that’s on her mind.
7) Children have a lot of natural energy. Enroll your child (especially boys) in an
active sport like soccer, softball, track, boxing, tennis, or swimming.
8) Give your child outlets for creativity such as music, theater, dance,
gymnastics, or art.
9) Have age-appropriate rules and consequences that your child understands
clearly. For example, bedtime is at 8:30, though he may read in bed until
9:00. When your child breaks a rule, calmly invoke a consequence without
yelling '''
